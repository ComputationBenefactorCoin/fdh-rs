Moving Window FDH
-----------------

This is an experimental Full Domain Hash (FDH) that is constructed of a moving-window applied against an extendable ouput (XOF) hash function.

This is experiemental, and has not been formally shown to be secure.

### Background and Rational

A Full Domain Hash is a hash function who's output lies within a specific domain, generally a range `(m, n]`, where `m` is the minimum and `n` is the maximum. 

XOF hash functions can be used directly as a full domain hash when `n` is exactly equal to the highest possible value of an XOF at a give output length. However, this is often not the case. For example, an FDH for use in RSA requires that the length of the FDH be equal to the bit-length of the modulus. However, the *value* of the FDH must lie below the value of the modulus. 

This is traditionally accomplished by constructing an FDH out of a fixed-length hash function and extending it as follows:

```
cycles=(target_length) / (digest_length) + 1
FDH(M) = HASH(M||(SV + 0)) || HASH(M||(SV + 0)) || ... || HASH(M||(SV + cyclesâˆ’1))

sv = 0
digest = FDH(message)
while not in_domain(digest):
    sv++
    digest = FDH(message, sv)
return digest
```

This traditional method works, but is computationally expensive because it requires recomputing `HASH(M||(IV + 0)` multiple times with every iteration of `IV`. For domains that require many iterations to find an acceptable digest, this can be very expensive computationally. 

### Description

The Moving Window Full Domain Hash (MWFDH) is constructed as follows:

Pseudocode:
```
H = XOF(message);
digest = H.read_bits(target_length)
while not in_domain(digest):
    digest = digest[1..] || H.read_bits(1) // equivilent to a bitshift
return digest
```

Each iteration of the MWFDH requires only a single bit shift.

In this example, an Extendable Output Hash Function outputs a digest one byte at a time. A moving window is applied against the output to find a one byte Full Domain Hash where the domain is larger than 240 (`11110000`). The final FDH digest value is `11110011`.
